## Smart predictive keyboard
The Smart Keyboard optimizes its key size dynamically based on the user input. Letters which don't appear in the dictionary after the sequence of letters currently typed are removed from the keyboard. The rest of letters are magnified in size according to the space available, helping users type faster with fewer errors. It also has contextual predictive capabilities using a neural network. The next most probable word based on past user inputs is suggested. Start typing into the box below by clicking/touching the appropriate key. Turning prediction on offers prediction for the next word based on the current input. The predictive model was trained used Gated Recurrent Units on Reddit comment data.
